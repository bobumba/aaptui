# AAP TUI Implementation Plan

Status: milestones 1 and 2 complete and verified offline.

This plan refines `SPEC.md` and follows `AGENTS.md`. No application code is
authorized by the design discussion alone. Implement one milestone at a time
when implementation is requested.

## Scope and decisions

- Support AAP 2.6 through the platform gateway or directly through controller.
- Use Bubble Tea v2, Bubbles components as needed, and Lip Gloss for styling.
  Pin compatible stable dependency versions during bootstrap.
- Use REST polling for live output, initially every two seconds. No WebSocket
  transport is planned.
- Include playbook jobs, workflow jobs, project updates, inventory updates,
  ad hoc commands, system jobs, and workflow approvals where the API exposes
  them. Preserve common details for unknown job types instead of hiding them.
- List only job templates through `job_templates/` in the Job Templates menu.
  List projects through `projects/` in the Projects menu, reusing the existing
  project summary and detail types. Retain type-aware detail readers for other
  template resources.
- Support template listing, search/filtering, and details. Launching,
  relaunching, approval/denial, and resource editing remain out of scope.
- Allow cancellation only for supported active jobs and the current token's
  permissions, following an explicit confirmation in the TUI.
- Keep output memory bounded. Fetch older output ranges on demand and use
  temporary cache files under the user's home directory when useful.
- Require HTTPS. Do not add private CA configuration, client certificates,
  reverse-proxy path prefixes, or plain HTTP support. Use system certificate
  trust; retain the specified TLS-verification setting, enabled by default.
- No AAP instance will be available. Offline tests and source review are the
  available verification methods; actual AAP 2.6 compatibility remains unverified.

Keep packages focused and add files as needed by milestones. Do not introduce
separate service, repository, or general-purpose utility layers.

## Package responsibilities

`cmd/aaptui` loads and validates configuration, constructs the HTTP client and
TUI dependencies, handles process signals, and ensures cleanup and terminal
restoration. Dependency injection is explicit; there is no global client.

`internal/config` loads connection settings and reads `AAP_TOKEN` separately.
It does not perform network requests or manage terminal state.

`internal/aap` owns REST paths, authentication, TLS, pagination, JSON decoding,
job-type dispatch, capability discovery, output transport, retries, cursors,
and output caching. It exposes Go resource types and operations, with no
Bubble Tea dependencies. HTTP response structs and server links stay private.

`internal/tui` owns navigation, selections, search input, layout, scrolling,
follow mode, loading/error state, and confirmation dialogs. Blocking operations
run in asynchronous commands and return typed result messages. Only the update
loop mutates TUI state. Consumer-defined interfaces allow tests with fakes.

## Configuration

Use JSON and the standard library. The default file is
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aaptui/config.json`, falling back to
`~/.config/aaptui/config.json`. Accept `--config PATH` to choose a different file.

| Setting | JSON field | Environment variable | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Server URL | `url` | `AAP_URL` | Required |
| Connection mode | `connection_mode` | `AAP_CONNECTION_MODE` | `gateway` |
| TLS verification | `tls_verify` | `AAP_TLS_VERIFY` | `true` |
| Authentication token | Forbidden | `AAP_TOKEN` | Required |

Apply defaults, then file values, then environment values. Track presence so
explicit `false` is not treated as missing. An absent default file is acceptable;
a missing explicitly selected file or malformed file is an error. Reject unknown
configuration fields, including token fields. Reject empty required values,
invalid booleans/modes, URL credentials, query strings, fragments, and unsupported
schemes or non-root URL paths.

Keep the token separate from printable settings, never persist it or accept it
as an argument, and redact it from error text. Display the connection mode and
whether TLS verification is disabled without displaying credentials.

## API behavior and Go types

Use `net/http`, `encoding/json`, and `context`. Inject the HTTP client, configure
request deadlines, and make all operations cancellable. Use `/api/controller/v2/`
for gateway mode and `/api/v2/` for direct mode.

Start job listing with `unified_jobs/`, supplementing only if documented API
behavior shows that an exposed required type is absent. Decode details and related
operations according to resource type. Use server-side search and bounded pages;
do not download entire collections for local filtering. Default to recent jobs
ordered newest first, with explicit pagination to older jobs.

Validate related and pagination links against the configured origin and allowed
controller API routes. Do not forward authentication to arbitrary links or
redirects. Distinguish connection, authentication, permission, malformed-response,
missing-resource, unsupported-operation, and temporary server failures. Wrap
errors with operation context and expose safe messages instead of raw bodies.

| Type | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `Settings`, `ConnectionMode` | Validated non-secret configuration |
| `Client` | Concrete API client and injected dependencies |
| `TemplateRef`, `TemplateType`, `TemplateSummary`, `TemplateDetails` | Typed template resources |
| `JobRef`, `JobType`, `JobStatus` | Job identity, kind, and state |
| `JobSummary`, `JobDetails` | Common fields and explicit optional type-specific details |
| `JobCapabilities` | Output, cancellation, and children: availability and reasons |
| `WorkflowNode` | Node state and optional child-job reference |
| `ListOptions`, `Page[T]`, `PageCursor` | Search and pagination without HTTP details |
| `OutputCursor`, `OutputChunk`, `OutputUpdate` | Output ranges, resume position, status, and follow errors |
| `OutputStore` | Concrete bounded memory/disk cache with range indexing |
| `APIError`, `ErrorKind` | Classified errors with safe presentation |

Use small TUI consumer interfaces for template reading, job reading, workflow
navigation, output reading/following, and cancellation. Their methods accept
contexts and use these types. Final signatures depend on the offline API contract
review; avoid speculative abstractions and transport-specific UI interfaces.

Capabilities distinguish unsupported operations, unavailable permissions, and
unknown capability. Server responses remain authoritative when permissions or
job state change. Cancellation is a distinct operation from cancelling a local
context. After an ambiguous cancellation response, refresh job state rather than
automatically repeating the mutation.

## Output and lifecycle

Fetch bounded output increments using verified range semantics for each supported
type. Decode output formats in the API layer and sanitize external terminal
control sequences before rendering. Do not assume JSON content is HTML or plain
text without reviewing its contract. Do not assume HTTP byte-range support.

Maintain a cursor per job/output session. Accept validated chunks into the output
store before advancing the cursor. Handle overlapping ranges and mutable partial
lines without duplication. Surface gaps, resets, expired output, and API output
size limits explicitly instead of silently dropping data.

Use a bounded viewport/history window in RAM and a bounded, indexed disk cache.
Create private session directories under `~/.cache/aaptui/` using `os.UserHomeDir`,
directory permissions `0700`, and file permissions `0600`. Do not use the system
temporary directory or an XDG cache location outside the user's home directory.
Use random cache names with no tokens or server-returned path components. Cache
files may contain sensitive job output; never copy the authentication token into
cache metadata. Redact the known token if it occurs in displayed or cached text.

Fetch uncached older ranges when scrolling. Eviction must not move the live
cursor backward. If the server no longer retains a requested range, explain the
missing history. Handle disk exhaustion and read/write/cleanup failures explicitly.
An API download-only fallback, if supported, must stream through bounded buffers
into the private cache and observe the disk budget. Select and document memory,
disk, and chunk limits during the output milestone.

Clean up owned cache files when the output session closes or the app exits. Never
delete unrelated files. Interrupted-process leftovers may remain; document their
location and avoid automatic broad cleanup of other sessions.

Polling and retry delays remain in the API package. Retry recoverable failures
with capped backoff, respecting rate-limit guidance where available. Preserve
accepted output and the cursor; show connection state and allow resuming.
Authentication/permission failures stop automatic retries. Use deterministic timing
controls in tests rather than real sleeps.

Scrolling up pauses automatic scrolling, not output collection. An explicit follow
action returns to the newest output. Leaving the output screen cancels its context,
requests, retry waits, and producer activity. Bound pending updates and ignore
messages from old session identifiers. Drain final output using the completion
evidence supported by the API; do not equate terminal job status with immediate
output completeness. Quitting stops all local activity without cancelling jobs.

Workflow details show child nodes, including pending nodes without a job and
inaccessible/deleted children. Allow navigation into nested workflows and child
output, preserving the back-navigation stack. Jobs without stdout show a clear
unavailable-output state while remaining viewable.

## Navigation

Main contains Job Templates, Jobs, Projects, and Inventories. Use Enter to open,
Esc to return, `q` to quit outside text entry, and Ctrl-C to quit consistently. Search input consumes
ordinary characters; Esc first exits input mode. Provide visible contextual help,
manual refresh where useful, page navigation, and output follow controls. Bind
server cancellation separately and require confirmation identifying the job.

## Milestones and acceptance tests

Implementation is authorized by the request to implement the remaining milestones.

| Milestone | Deliverable | Independently testable acceptance criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Inventories main menu | Add Inventories as a main menu option and list inventories for selection | Verify the main menu includes Inventories, opening it lists inventories, and back navigation returns to the main menu. |
| 2. Inventory groups and hosts | Selecting an inventory opens a submenu with Groups and Hosts | Verify Hosts lists all hosts in the selected inventory, including hosts across pages. Verify Groups displays the inventory's groups and allows traversal through groups to display hosts. Verify back navigation preserves the selected inventory and traversal context. |

Milestone 1: inventory API reader, searchable/paginated list, menu wiring, and
back navigation implemented. `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...` passed.

Milestone 2: inventories open Groups/Hosts; groups open Child groups/Hosts.
Group Hosts includes descendants through `all_hosts/`. Each collection uses
bounded server pages with `n`/`p` navigation, search, and refresh. Back navigation
restores inventory/group identity, page, search, and selection. API and TUI tests
use synthetic fixtures for both gateway and direct prefixes.

Final verification: changed Go files formatted with `gofmt -w`;
`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `go test -race ./...`, and `git diff --check`
passed. Deployed AAP 2.6 validation remains unavailable.

For each implementation milestone: format changed Go files with `gofmt -w`, run
`go test ./...` and `go vet ./...`, review changes for unintended scope, and update
relevant documentation. Use `go test -race ./...` for concurrent output/lifecycle
work. Finish and verify one milestone before moving to the next.

## Verification limits and references

Fixtures must identify whether they are synthetic, source-derived, or captured.
No captured AAP fixtures or deployed-instance acceptance tests are available.
Fake-server success proves behavior against modeled contracts, not compatibility
with an actual AAP installation. Keep this limitation visible in the README.

Prefer AAP 2.6 documentation; use version-pinned upstream AWX source only as
supporting evidence and record that distinction. Public upstream behavior is not
an AAP 2.6 compatibility guarantee. Do not make instance access a completion gate
for the agreed offline implementation.
